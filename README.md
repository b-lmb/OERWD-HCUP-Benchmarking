# Analysis of aspergillosis and histoplasmosis inpatient encounters

This repository contains the analysis code and data processing scripts for the manuscript titled *A Comparative Analysis Estimating Aspergillosis and Histoplasmosis Encounters among Inpatients in the United States Using Multi-Regional Electronic Health Record and National Discharge Data, 2014-2020*. The study compares inpatient encounters for aspergillosis and histoplasmosis between the Oracle EHR Real World Data (OERWD) and the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample (HCUP NIS).
